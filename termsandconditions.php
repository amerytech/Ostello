<H2> Making and cancelling a booking</H2>
<ul class="nonum">
<p>2.1) On making a booking, you will be required to pay a non-refundable deposit (being a fixed percentage of the total value of your booking. We collect this deposit for and on behalf of the relevant travel services provider.  

</p>
<p>You will also be required to pay a flat booking fee, which is our fee for making the booking and this is non-refundable unless you have signed up for membership of our website (see details below). </p>
<p>You will be responsible to the travel services provider on arrival for payment of the balance of the cost of the booking made by you, together with any other payments for any additional services subsequently agreed with the travel services provider and, where applicable, payment of the travel services provider's service charges and taxes, pursuant to the terms and conditions of trade applied by such travel services provider. </p>
<p>2.2) You must use a credit card or debit card to guarantee a booking. BY MAKING A BOOKING WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD OR DEBIT CARD, YOU AGREE TO ACCEPT THE RELEVANT CANCELLATION AND NO-SHOW POLICY OF THE TRAVEL SERVICES PROVIDER AS SET OUT IN ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT YOU CANCEL YOUR BOOKING OUTSIDE THE PERMITTED TIMEFRAME SPECIFIED IN THIS POLICY (OR THAT YOU FAIL TO ARRIVE BY YOUR AGREED CHECK-IN TIME), YOU AUTHORISE THE TRAVEL SERVICES PROVIDER TO CHARGE TO YOUR CREDIT CARD OR DEBIT CARD WITHOUT FURTHER REFERENCE TO YOU AN AMOUNT NOT EXCEEDING THE CHARGE FOR ONE NIGHT'S STAY (IN THE CASE OF ACCOMMODATION) OR SUCH OTHER AMOUNT AS MAY BE SET OUT IN THE TRAVEL SERVICE PROVIDER'S TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  </p>
<p>2.3) Your non-arrival by the agreed check-in time may result in the cancellation of your entire booking. Any amendments to your booking must be notified to and agreed with the travel services provider directly (but no refund of all or any part of the deposit will be made). In making a booking, it shall be your responsibility to disclose to the travel services provider any requirements or special facilities that you or a member of your party may need as a result of any medical conditions. </p>
<p>2.4) When a booking is confirmed we will issue the booking confirmation on behalf of the travel services provider for each booking, but will not provide information about any charges for additional services or details of the service charge or taxes charged by the travel services provider. We strongly recommend you check and confirm with the travel services provider the precise terms and conditions upon which the travel services provider makes the reserved service available to you upon receipt of the booking confirmation. The reference numbers included on the booking confirmation should be quoted in all enquiries, cancellation or modification of the booking. </p>
<p>2.5) You may cancel your booking in accordance with the cancellation policy of the provider as disclosed on the booking confirmation and detailed property description page; this is normally at least 24 hours before your agreed check-in time and date. Please cancel via your "My Bookings" by logging in at www.ostello.in.</p>
<p>2.6) If you choose to cancel your booking then, regardless of how much notice you give, DEPOSITS WILL BE NON REFUNDABLE. BOOKING FEES WILL ALSO BE NON REFUNDABLE IN THE EVENT OF A CANCELLATION UNLESS YOU HAVE SIGNED UP FOR A ostello.in SMARTSAVERS MEMBERSHIP. </p>
<p>2.7) The deposit and the booking fee that you pay will be payable in the currency that you select as your "settlement currency" when making your booking.  Where the accommodation price was uploaded by the travel services provider in a different currency, the deposit amount that you will be charged in your settlement currency will be calculated by converting the deposit price into your settlement currency using using our standard exchange rates.</p>

<ul class="nonum">
<p>9.1) Full details of our privacy policy can be found at <a href="#"> www.ostello.in/privacy.php</a>, which is hereby incorporated into and forms part of these Terms. We operate by the following principles:</p>
<p>9.2) We provide your information to the necessary third party travel service providers when you reserve, purchase or review travel services through our website.

We also use your details to operate our website and, occasionally, to inform you of new features, services and products from us (subject to the preferences you have expressed to us).

On occasion, we may supply statistics about our customers to third parties such as travel services providers or other agents. These statistics never contain personally identifying information. </p>
<p>9.3) While our terms require that accommodation owners display prices which are inclusive of all value added and other additional taxes, the price displayed is ultimately the responsibility of the accommodation owner rather than ours. The traveller acknowledges that we shall not have liability to the traveller in respect of any attempt by an accommodation owner to levy additional value added or other taxes on the traveller at the point of payment as a supplement to the price displayed and the travellers sole recourse in this regard will be against the travel services provider.</p>
<p>9.4) If at any time you believe that we have not adhered to these principles, please notify us via the Contact Form and we will use all reasonable efforts to determine and correct the problem promptly. If you have any questions, please contact us by post at: One Central Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18 or via email at: <a href="mailto:service@ostello.in">service@ostello.in</a>.</p>

<H2> PRE-PAYMENT, CANCELLATION, NO-SHOW AND FINE PRINT</H2>
<ul class="nonum">
<p>10.1) By making a reservation with a Supplier, you accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of that Supplier, and to any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the Supplier that may apply to your visit or stay (including the fine print of the Supplier made available on our Platform and the relevant house rules of the Supplier), including for services rendered and/or products offered by the accommodation provider (the delivery terms and conditions of an accommodation provider can be obtained with the relevant accommodation provider). The general cancellation and no-show policy of each Supplier is made available on our Platform on the Supplier information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the confirmation email or ticket (if applicable). Please note that certain rates or special offers are not eligible for cancellation or change. Applicable city/tourist tax may still be charged by the Supplier in the event of a no-show or charged cancellation. Please check the (reservation) details of your product or service of choice thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. Please note that a reservation which requires down payment or (wholly or partly) prepayment may be cancelled (without a prior notice of default or warning) insofar the relevant (remaining) amount(s) cannot be collected in full on the relevant payment date in accordance with the relevant payment policy of the Supplier and the reservation. Cancellation and prepayment policies may vary according to room type. Please carefully read the fine print (below the room types or at the bottom of each Supplier page on our Platform) and important information in your reservation confirmation for additional policies as may be applied by the Supplier (e.g. in respect of age requirement, security deposit, non-cancellation/additional supplements for group bookings, extra beds/no free breakfast, pets/cards accepted). Late payment, wrong bank, debit or credit card details, invalid credit/debit cards or insufficient funds are for your own risk and account and you shall not be entitled to any refund of any (non-refundable) prepaid amount unless the Supplier agrees or allows otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy.</p>
<p>10.2) If you wish to review, adjust or cancel your reservation, please revert to the confirmation email and follow the instructions therein. Please note that you may be charged for your cancellation in accordance with the accommodation provider's cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy or not be entitled to any repayment of any (pre)paid amount. We recommend that you read the cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy of the accommodation provider carefully prior to making your reservation and remember to make further payments on time as may be required for the relevant reservation.</p>
<p>10.3) If you have a late or delayed arrival on the check-in date or only arrive the next day, make sure to (timely/promptly) communicate this with the Supplier so they know when to expect you to avoid cancellation of your reservation or room or charge of the no-show fee. Our customer service department can help you if needed with informing the Supplier. Booking.com does not accept any liability or responsibility for the consequences of your delayed arrival or any cancellation or charged no-show fee by the Supplier.</p>
